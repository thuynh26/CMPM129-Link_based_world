An exercise in building data-driven game design

## Game Premise

Your grandparents ran a popular café back in the day, and you're determined to bring it back to life. But there's a catch, the secret recipe book has gone missing. It's up to you to:

- Explore different rooms in the café
- Collect ingredients throughout the building
- Experiment with drink combinations at the drink counter
- Figure out how to unlock the drawer hiding the recipe book
